npm run dev
```

### Deployment to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

To deploy this app to Vercel:
	1.	Create an account on Vercel.
	2.	Link your GitHub repository to Vercel.
	3.	Vercel will automatically detect the project settings and deploy it.

Make sure to set up your environment variables in Vercel as well, by going to your project settings and adding the required keys under the Environment Variables section.

### Customizing the Build

You can customize the build based on your theme and project configuration:


1. Update the siteConfig object for each theme in the `pages/_app.js` file. For example:
```bas
const config = sites[host] || sites.default;
```

2.	Modify the text, images, and other UI components to fit your projectâ€™s branding. The content for each page is stored in the respective themeâ€™s section of the config file.

3.	Add new routes or modify existing ones to support additional features.


### Database Configuration

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for storing user entries and other data.
1.	Set up your PostgreSQL database on [Neon](neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
2.	Connect your database to the project by configuring the `POSTGRES_URL` in the `.env.local` file.

Additional Customization
-	You can easily add new pages or components to the project by creating new files in the pages or components directories.
-	To add more themes, simply extend the copyByTheme object in the relevant page files and add corresponding text content.

```
Each file plays a specific role:
-	`components/`: Contains reusable UI elements that ensure consistency across pages.
-	`config/sites.js`: Define the new theme with specific configuration.
-	`pages/`: Houses the Next.js pages including API routes and different view screens.
-	`styles/main.css`: Provides a basic style reset and common styling rules to be applied throughout the project.
-	`.env.local`: Allows configuration of variables such as form version and promotion start date without hardcoding in your code.


### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues during deployment, check the logs on Vercel and ensure that all environment variables are set correctly.
- If you see Database connection failed errors, ensure that your PostgreSQL database credentials are correct and that your server is running.
- For any React hydration errors, make sure your server-side rendering and client-side rendering are consistent.
