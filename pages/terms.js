                                not respond by noon on Monday 9 June that winner will be disqualified and a reserve
                                winner will be contacted and asked to provide the same information. A reserve will have
                                until 12noon on Thursday 12 June to respond.

                                terms and conditions will result in a provisional winner being disqualified and a
                                reserve will be contacted in the same manner. If after approaching 1 reserve the
                                Promoter has failed to allocate that prize, the Promoter shall not be obliged to
                                approach any additional reserves and shall be entitled to withdraw the relevant prize

                    <li>The Promoter is not liable for third party products or services.</li>

                    <li>If for any reason the Promotion is not capable of running as planned for reasons beyond the

                        written directions given under applicable law) to disqualify any individual who tampers with the
                        running of the Promotion or to cancel, amend, terminate or temporarily suspend this promotion,

                        Promoter and which prevents the Promoter from complying with these terms and conditions the
                        Promoter will not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing an affected
                        obligation. In exceptional circumstances including those described here, the Promoter reserves
                        the right to cancel, amend, terminate or temporarily suspend this Promotion and to invalidate

                            provisional winner must respond within 10 working days of the date of first notification,
                            confirming compliance with these terms and conditions and eligibility and including a copy
                            of their passport or drivers licence (or other government issued form of photographic

                            evidence of compliance with these terms and conditions will result in the provisional winner

                            timeframe and verification requirements. If after approaching two reserves, the Promoter has
                            failed to allocate the prize, the Promoter shall not be obliged to approach any additional
                            reserves and shall be entitled to withdraw the prize and allocate it as the Promoter sees
                            fit. Entrants are encouraged to monitor their email account during this time in case they
                            are a winner.

                            reserves and shall be entitled to withdraw the prize and allocate it as the Promoter sees

                            are a winner.

                            independent body within 5 working days of the end of the Promotion Period. One winner and
                            two reserves will be selected.
                        </li>
                        <li>Winner notification: The provisional winner will be notified by email to the contact details
                            associated with the winning entry within 2 working day of the winner selection. The
                            provisional winner must respond within 10 working days of the date of first notification,
                            confirming compliance with these terms and conditions and eligibility and including a copy
                            of their passport or drivers licence (or other government issued form of photographic
                            identification which includes the winner’s name and date of birth), at which point the
                            winner will be confirmed. Failure to comply with this timeframe, or failure to provide
                            evidence of compliance with these terms and conditions will result in the provisional winner
                            being disqualified and a reserve will be contacted in the same manner and with the same
                            timeframe and verification requirements. If after approaching two reserves, the Promoter has
                            failed to allocate the prize, the Promoter shall not be obliged to approach any additional
                            reserves and shall be entitled to withdraw the prize and allocate it as the Promoter sees
                            fit. Entrants are encouraged to monitor their email account during this time in case they
                            are a winner.

                                be confirmed. If a winner does not respond by noon on Monday 9 June that winner will
                                be disqualified and a reserve winner will be contacted and asked to provide the same

                                compliance with these terms and conditions will result in a provisional winner being
                                disqualified and a reserve will be contacted in the same manner. If after

                                shall not be obliged to approach any additional reserves and shall be entitled to
